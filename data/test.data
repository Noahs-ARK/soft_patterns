the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .

maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
boring we did n't .

it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -lrb- woody allen -rrb- has made in the last twenty years .
it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you .
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .

frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
a very average science fiction film .
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .

preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
most of the action setups are incoherent .
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
dreary , highly annoying ... ` some body ' will appeal to no one .
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .

a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .

national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .

overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way .
it settles for being merely grim .
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .

somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane .
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
i tried to read the time on my watch .
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc. .
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` what 's the point ? '
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie .
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
just a bloody mess .
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .
bears is bad .
